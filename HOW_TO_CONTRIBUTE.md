## Your own ideas
We encourage you to poke around the codebase, find flaws and ways to improve it. The prompts and responses are also logged locally in your machine so you should be able to very quickly triage things.
If you want a new feature or want to change something, please reach out to us on [discrod](https://discord.gg/mtgrhXM5Xf) or create an issue on the repo.
